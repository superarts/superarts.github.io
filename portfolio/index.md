Mpire Media PTE Ltd., Perth, May 2011 - Feb 2014
===
- Worked on several iOS and Android projects, including Music Charts Player, Flipevent, Android Antivirus & Security, etc.
- Fully responsible of creating and maintaining mobile apps based on company’s marketing direction. Building apps for different affiliates in multiple regions. Reviewing product specifications based on technical aspect and making advice. Keeping all the projects on schedule. 
- Cooperating with marketing department to make quick changes based on live marking result. Monitoring tracking status and reporting regularly.
- Cooperating with web development team to design new protocols, implement new features, and analyze and fix issues.
- Cooperating with a newly founded Croatian mobile development team to work together on some recent mobile apps, e.g. App Lounge, Cloud Miner, etc. 
- Taking care of modules outsourced to other independent developers.
- Example Android Project: [Android Antivirus & Security](http://androidantiviruspro.com/) (link doesn't work due to product support stopped)
- The main product we promoted in a lot of countries, including Australia, UK, South Africa, Belgium, Norway, China etc. I'm doing all the development on the mobile side and part of the designs. Aside from UI and functionality implementation which includes Activities, Broadcasting Receivers, Async Tasks etc, we’ve developed a whole set of tools on both client and server sides, including app config, app tracking, etc. since it's very important for the company to monitor the performance of the app as well as user behaviors.
- Example iOS Project: [Music Charts Player](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/music-charts-player/id452948824?l=en&mt=8) (link does't work due to product support stopped)
- An iOS app that I've developed in Mpire Media. Although we were not able to market it properly, I'm still quite happy about the thing it did. It is designed by our professional developer and I've learned a lot from it too, since I was the one who’d been doing app design mostly myself previously. From the technical aspect, UI, network, and media play frameworks were used. I also wrote a web service using PHP and MySQL to generate various music charts on our server. 

Independent Developer, Melbourne, Dec 2010 - May 2011
===
- Worked on several iPhone apps during this period of time.
- Example iOS Project: Suar Photo Sharing - [iTunes Link](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/suar-photo-share/id479530843?mt=8)
- A social networking app I've been working on before I was employed in Australia. It's my personal project and I wrote a GAE based NoSQL engine to back it up. It's very much like the Parse API and actually I have built some similar thing based on AWS as well, which was used by another app called Readish (which was discontinued because of the shutdown of Google Reader), and eventually in my recent project I moved to Parse. I'm still quite happy with the fact that I was working on the right direction, although I could get enough resource to make it a successful product myself. I also put some effort to make the UI of the app looks a bit different by introducing a dynamic photo matrix with animation.

- Worked on several iPhone apps architecture design and implementation. 
Lead projects to production based on various requirements of the clients. Although the initial product spec and product schedule should always followed, for some (large cooperation) clients sometimes there are additional requirements due to their own business modal. My duty is also to work on their new requirements and make arrangements to ensure the products’ quality, and make them go live as soon as possible.

- Example iOS Project: Citibank Singapore - [iTunes Link](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/citibank-sg/id370773317?mt=8)
- The app was not exactly the same with the one I built when I left Mobiquest, but I contributed a lot in refactoring the old app and brought it into a new level by introduced a more robust framework. I was part of the development team, and introduced some cool stuff like arrangeable button matrix etc. I always put new features into different libraries, design proper interface and write documents to make the code reusable.

It allows various media operation, such as joining, adding metadata, trimming, etc. on various media formats (containers mostly), including mp4/mov, flv, mp3, ogg, vob/mpeg2, wmv/asf, etc. These operations are done on the fly, which means the media is serving to users dynamically.
