To whom it may concern,

I’m a senior mobile developer who’s focusing on iOS and Android development for more than 7 years, and have been working as a senior developer for 10 years. Previously I worked in China and Singapore since 2004, and I’ve been working in Australian for 4.5 years.

I’m living in Sydney at the moment, and wish to work as a tech lead or senior developer in the US. Please contact me if offering me E3 visa sponsorship is an option for your company. Any and all help would be much appreciated.

Please check my website for my resume online: superarts.org/resume


I have 7 years experience in iOS development (11 years in total as a software developer) and have extensive knowledge in iOS development, including how Obj-C / Swift works which allows me to build the architecture of the apps with both readability and efficiency. I’m good at mastering new technology and building them into the products, for example WatchKit and HealthKit. Other than this, I have all sort of experience in mobile development, including UIKit, MapKit, push notification etc.

I'm an Australian citizen and wish to work in the US with E3 visa sponsorship. I heard it's much quicker and easier to get than H1B (2-3 days and about $500 fee applied), but still sponsorship from a US employer is needed. Cheers.

- Example Android Project: [Android Antivirus & Security](http://androidantiviruspro.com/) (link doesn't work due to product support stopped)
- The main product we promoted in a lot of countries, including Australia, UK, South Africa, Belgium, Norway, China etc. I'm doing all the development on the mobile side and part of the designs. Aside from UI and functionality implementation which includes Activities, Broadcasting Receivers, Async Tasks etc, we’ve developed a whole set of tools on both client and server sides, including app config, app tracking, etc. since it's very important for the company to monitor the performance of the app as well as user behaviors.
- Example iOS Project: [Music Charts Player](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/music-charts-player/id452948824?l=en&mt=8) (link does't work due to product support stopped)
- An iOS app that I've developed in Mpire Media. Although we were not able to market it properly, I'm still quite happy about the thing it did. It is designed by our professional developer and I've learned a lot from it too, since I was the one who’d been doing app design mostly myself previously. From the technical aspect, UI, network, and media play frameworks were used. I also wrote a web service using PHP and MySQL to generate various music charts on our server.

- Worked on several iPhone apps during this period of time.
- Example iOS Project: Suar Photo Sharing - [iTunes Link](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/suar-photo-share/id479530843?mt=8)
- A social networking app I've been working on before I was employed in Australia. It's my personal project and I wrote a GAE based NoSQL engine to back it up. It's very much like the Parse API and actually I have built some similar thing based on AWS as well, which was used by another app called Readish (which was discontinued because of the shutdown of Google Reader), and eventually in my recent project I moved to Parse. I'm still quite happy with the fact that I was working on the right direction, although I could get enough resource to make it a successful product myself. I also put some effort to make the UI of the app looks a bit different by introducing a dynamic photo matrix with animation.
